# Workflow file => YAML (.yaml/.yml) file containing the automation code
# Inside workflow file are 4 components: event, runner, job and step
# Event (Trigger): activity that starts/triggers the github actions workflow e.g. pushing code to repo "[on:]"
# Runner (Computer): Virtual server (github's or yours) that executes your instructions "[runs_on:]"
# Job (Mission): Group of steps running on the same runner/virtal computer
# Step (Task): Individual commands e.g. installing mysql

# The Workflow is the whole container...
# ... It contains one or more Jobs (which can run at the same time)...
# ... Each Job contains multiple Steps (which run one after another)

# place your github actions workflow in ".github/workflows" directory in your project/repo
# assign a value to "on" attribute to triggers events e.g. on: push

# each workflow must have atleast one job
